# Unemployment_Rates_and_Crime_Analysis


The study serves to analyze the unemployment rate and crime relationship in the United States using panel data from 2011-2018 over all fifty states. A multiple regression analysis is performed over an or- dinary least squares regression model. Specific variables are determined and tested along with the unemployment rate to see their effects on crime. The results show that there is a positive linear relationship between the unemployment rate and crime. Therefore, it can be determined that the unemployment rate positively affects crime but not necessarily that higher unemployment rates cause higher crime rates.
